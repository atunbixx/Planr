# RSVP System Architecture Summary

## Executive Summary

The RSVP system has been designed as a secure, user-friendly solution that allows wedding guests to respond to invitations without requiring user accounts. The system leverages existing invite codes already present in the database and provides a seamless experience for both guests and couples.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **No Authentication Required**
- Guests access their RSVP using a 6-character invite code
- Session-based authentication after code validation
- 2-hour session duration with automatic refresh

### 2. **Security First Approach**
- Rate limiting on code validation (5 attempts per hour)
- Progressive delays after failed attempts
- IP-based blocking for suspicious activity
- CSRF protection on all form submissions
- Comprehensive audit logging

### 3. **Mobile-First Design**
- Responsive interface optimized for phones
- Step-by-step form flow
- Progress indicators
- Auto-save functionality

### 4. **Integration with Existing System**
- Leverages existing `wedding_guests` table
- Uses already-generated invite codes
- Maintains compatibility with admin dashboard
- Seamless data flow between public and admin interfaces

## System Components

### Database Schema
- **Existing**: `wedding_guests` table with `invite_code` field
- **New Tables**:
  - `meal_options`: Customizable meal choices per wedding
  - `rsvp_sessions`: Session management and rate limiting
  - `rsvp_activity_logs`: Comprehensive audit trail

### URL Structure
```
/rsvp                    → Landing page (code entry)
/rsvp/[code]            → Main RSVP form
/rsvp/[code]/confirm    → Confirmation page
/rsvp/[code]/edit       → Edit existing response
/rsvp/[code]/success    → Success page
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/rsvp/validate-code`: Validate invite code and create session
- `GET /api/rsvp/[code]/guest`: Retrieve guest information
- `PUT /api/rsvp/[code]/response`: Update RSVP response
- `GET /api/rsvp/[code]/meal-options`: Get available meal options

## Security Measures

### Rate Limiting
- **Per IP**: 5 validation attempts per hour
- **Per Code**: 10 attempts per day
- **Global**: 1000 attempts per hour (DDoS protection)

### Data Protection
- No personal information in URLs
- HTTPS enforced everywhere
- Session cookies (HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite)
- Input validation and sanitization
- XSS and CSRF protection

### Privacy
- Guests can only access their own information
- Audit logs track all access and changes
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Right to update or delete information

## User Experience Flow

### Guest Journey
1. **Receive Invitation**: Physical or digital with invite code
2. **Visit RSVP Page**: Enter code at /rsvp
3. **Verify Identity**: System validates code and creates session
4. **Complete RSVP**: Step-by-step form
   - Attendance confirmation
   - Meal selection
   - Dietary restrictions
   - Plus-one management
   - Additional notes
5. **Receive Confirmation**: Email with details and calendar link
6. **Update if Needed**: Return using same code to edit

### Admin Features
- Real-time RSVP tracking dashboard
- Export guest lists and meal counts
- Send reminder emails
- View response analytics
- Generate QR codes for invitations

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Hook Form for form management
- Sonner for toast notifications

### Backend Architecture
- Next.js API Routes
- Supabase for database and auth
- Redis/Upstash for rate limiting
- Edge Functions for secure operations
- Resend for email delivery

### Key Components
- `RSVPForm`: Main multi-step form
- `InviteCodeForm`: Code validation component
- `AttendanceSelector`: Yes/No/Maybe selection
- `MealSelector`: Meal choice interface
- `PlusOneForm`: Plus-one management
- `RSVPProgress`: Progress indicator

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Code splitting for RSVP bundle
- Lazy loading for images
- CDN for static assets
- Database indexing on invite_code
- Redis caching for session data

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling ready
- Database connection pooling
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Efficient query patterns
- Minimal server-side processing

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Features (Weeks 1-2)
- Database schema setup
- Basic RSVP flow
- Code validation
- Session management
- Simple form submission

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Weeks 3-4)
- Meal selection system
- Plus-one management
- Dietary restrictions
- Email confirmations
- Mobile optimization

### Phase 3: Polish & Integration (Weeks 5-6)
- Admin dashboard integration
- Analytics and reporting
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Comprehensive testing

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Key Metrics
- Response rate (% of guests who RSVP)
- Completion rate (% who finish form)
- Average time to complete
- Error rates and types
- Performance metrics

### Alerts
- High error rates (>5%)
- Rate limit spikes
- Session creation failures
- Email delivery issues
- Database connection problems

## Success Criteria

1. **Security**: Zero security breaches, <0.1% fraud rate
2. **Performance**: <2s page load, <100ms API response
3. **Usability**: >90% completion rate, <5% support requests
4. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime, <0.1% error rate
5. **Scalability**: Handle 1000+ concurrent users

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve architecture
2. Set up development environment
3. Create database migrations
4. Implement core RSVP flow
5. Add security measures
6. Build admin features
7. Conduct security audit
8. Performance testing
9. Deploy to production
10. Monitor and iterate

## Conclusion

The RSVP system architecture provides a secure, scalable, and user-friendly solution for wedding guest management. By leveraging existing infrastructure and following security best practices, the system ensures a smooth experience for both guests and couples while maintaining data privacy and system integrity.
