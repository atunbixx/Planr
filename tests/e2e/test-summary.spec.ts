Based on the test runs, here's what we've confirmed:

✅ WORKING:
1. Basic page navigation (/, /sign-up, /sign-in)
2. Page titles and headers are loading correctly
3. Form elements are visible and can be filled
4. 404 page is working (shows custom error page)
5. The application is running on port 4000

❌ ISSUES FOUND:
1. After sign-up, users get a 500 error instead of going to onboarding
   - This appears to be a database/session issue
   - The onboarding page expects a database record that doesn't exist for new users

🔧 TEST LIMITATIONS:
1. Only Chromium browser is installed (Firefox/Safari tests fail)
2. Full user journey tests require database seeding or mocking
3. Form validation appears to be client-side only (not showing expected errors)

📊 TEST COVERAGE ACHIEVED:
- Authentication pages UI: ✅
- Basic navigation: ✅
- Form interaction: ✅
- Error pages: ✅
- Full user flows: ❌ (blocked by database issues)

🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Fix the onboarding page to handle new users without existing database records
2. Add database seeding for E2E tests
3. Install all Playwright browsers for cross-browser testing
4. Consider using test users with pre-seeded data
