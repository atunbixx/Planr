## ðŸš€ Addressing the "2% Fee Objection"

### **The Reframe Strategy**

#### **Not a Fee - It's Premium Business Insurance**
```
"Mr. Vendor, let me ask you:

What would you pay for:
âœ… Guaranteed payment within 48 hours?
âœ… Zero payment collection stress?
âœ… Professional contracts for every job?
âœ… Access to 700+ wedding planners' clients?
âœ… Protection from bad clients?
âœ… Professional business tools worth â‚¦200K/year?

Most vendors say â‚¦50,000-100,000/month would be reasonable.

Our platform gives you all this for just 2% per transaction - 
often less than â‚¦20,000/month for most vendors.

Plus, you'll likely make 20-30% MORE revenue through our 
client network than you lose to the 2% fee."
```

### **The Success Stories (Social Proof)**

#### **Vendor Testimonials:**
```
"Before the platform, I chased payments for weeks and lost 
â‚¦200,000 to a client who disappeared. Now I get paid 
automatically and have booked 40% more weddings through 
planner referrals. The 2% fee pays for itself 10x over."
- Tunde, Event Photographer

"I was skeptical about the fee, but in 6 months I've made 
â‚¦3M more in bookings than I would have otherwise. The 
platform's marketing exposure alone is worth the fee."
- Sarah, Wedding Decorator
```
