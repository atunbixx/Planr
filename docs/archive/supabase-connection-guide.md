# Get Your Correct Supabase Connection String

The hostname `db.gpfxxbhowailwllpgphe.supabase.co` is not DNS-resolvable, so we need to get the correct one from your dashboard.

## Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gpfxxbhowailwllpgphe/settings/database

## Step 2: Find Connection Info
Look for one of these sections:
- "Connection Info"
- "Connection string" 
- "Database Settings"
- "Connection pooling"

## Step 3: Look for Connection String (URI)
It should look like one of these formats:

### Format 1: Pooler (Most Common)
```
postgresql://postgres.gpfxxbhowailwllpgphe:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

### Format 2: Direct Connection
```
postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@[some-other-hostname]:5432/postgres
```

### Format 3: Regional
```
postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@us-west-1-[number].supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

## Step 4: Copy the Hostname
From whatever connection string you see, copy just the hostname part (the part between @ and :)

Examples:
- `aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com` ✅
- `us-west-1-123.supabase.co` ✅
- `gpfxxbhowailwllpgphe.supabase.co` ✅ (maybe)
- `db.gpfxxbhowailwllpgphe.supabase.co` ❌ (this doesn't work)

## What to Share
Just tell me the **hostname** part (you can keep the password private), and I'll update your .env file immediately.

Example: "The hostname is: aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com"
