# Onboarding Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive onboarding flow for new users after they sign up with Clerk authentication. The onboarding collects essential wedding planning information through a beautiful 4-step carousel interface.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Onboarding Page** (`/src/app/onboarding/page.tsx`)
- Converted from a simple redirect page to a full onboarding experience
- Checks if user has already completed onboarding
- Displays the carousel flow with progress tracking
- Shows feature previews at the bottom
- Beautiful rose/purple gradient design

### 2. **Onboarding Flow Component** (`/src/components/onboarding/OnboardingFlow.tsx`)
- Already existed in the codebase
- 4-step carousel with auto-save functionality
- Saves progress to localStorage after each change
- Handles form submission to create couple profile

### 3. **Step Components**
- **Step 1: About You** - Collects user and partner names
- **Step 2: Wedding Details** - Wedding style and date
- **Step 3: Venue & Location** - Venue name and location
- **Step 4: Planning & Budget** - Guest count and budget

### 4. **Progress Bar** (`/src/components/onboarding/ProgressBar.tsx`)
- Enhanced with better visual design
- Shows step titles and progress percentage
- Animated transitions between steps

### 5. **Middleware Updates** (`/src/middleware.ts`)
- Added logic to redirect new users to onboarding
- Checks if user is within 5 minutes of account creation
- Protects dashboard routes until onboarding is complete

### 6. **API Endpoints**
- **GET /api/user/onboarding-status** - Checks if user has completed onboarding
- **POST /api/couples** - Saves onboarding data and creates couple profile

## How It Works

### New User Flow:
1. User signs up with Clerk
2. Clerk redirects to `/onboarding` (configured in Clerk dashboard or env vars)
3. User sees welcome message and 4-step carousel
4. User fills out information (only name is required)
5. Progress auto-saves to localStorage
6. On completion, data is saved to database
7. User is redirected to `/dashboard`

### Existing User Flow:
1. User signs in with Clerk
2. If they have a couple profile, go directly to `/dashboard`
3. If no couple profile, redirect to `/onboarding`

## Configuration Required

### In Clerk Dashboard:
Set these URLs in your Clerk application settings:
- **After sign up URL**: `/onboarding`
- **After sign in URL**: `/dashboard`

### Or in `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/onboarding
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
```

## Key Features

1. **Auto-Save**: Progress is automatically saved to localStorage after each field change
2. **Minimal Friction**: Only user's name is required, all other fields optional
3. **Skip Options**: Users can skip steps and complete profile later
4. **Beautiful UI**: Rose/purple gradients, smooth animations, responsive design
5. **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar with step indicators
6. **Feature Preview**: Shows what features they'll unlock after completion

## Testing

To test the onboarding flow:
1. Create a new account using Clerk sign-up
2. Verify you're redirected to `/onboarding`
3. Complete all 4 steps (or skip some)
4. Verify redirect to `/dashboard` after completion
5. Check database for created user and couple records

## Database Schema

The onboarding creates records in:
- `users` table - Basic user information
- `couples` table - Wedding-specific information including:
  - partner names
  - wedding date and style
  - venue details
  - guest count and budget
  - onboarding completion status

## Next Steps

Users who complete onboarding can:
- Access all dashboard features
- Add and manage guests
- Track budget and expenses
- Manage vendors
- Upload photos
- Use all planning tools

Users who skip onboarding will be prompted to complete their wedding profile when trying to use features that require it (like adding guests).
