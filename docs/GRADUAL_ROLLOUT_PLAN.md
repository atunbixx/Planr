# Gradual Feature Rollout Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step plan for safely integrating hidden backend features into the production frontend.

## Rollout Phases

### Pre-Launch Preparation (Week 0)
- [x] Create feature flag system
- [x] Implement SafeFeatureWrapper component
- [x] Build safe API utilities
- [x] Set up health monitoring
- [ ] Deploy infrastructure without enabling features
- [ ] Verify monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Set up error tracking

### Phase 1: Core Features (Weeks 1-4)

#### Week 1: Seating Planner (Read-Only)
**Day 1-2: Infrastructure**
```bash
# Enable in .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SEATING=false  # Start disabled
```
- Deploy SafeFeatureWrapper integration
- Add navigation item (hidden by default)
- Implement read-only seating view

**Day 3-4: Testing**
- Internal team testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Error rate monitoring

**Day 5: Gradual Enable**
```bash
# Enable for 10% of users
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SEATING=true
```
- Monitor error rates
- Check performance impact
- Gather early feedback

#### Week 2: Seating Planner (Full)
- Enable guest assignment
- Add drag-and-drop functionality
- Implement auto-save
- Roll out to 50% users

#### Week 3: Wedding Checklist
**Implementation**
- Read-only checklist view
- Task completion UI
- Progress tracking
- Category filtering

**Rollout**
- Start at 10% users
- Monitor completion rates
- Scale to 50% by end of week

#### Week 4: Day-of Timeline
**Implementation**
- Timeline visualization
- Event management
- Vendor coordination view
- Real-time updates (disabled initially)

**Rollout**
- Beta group only (5%)
- Gather feedback
- Fix issues before wider release

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Weeks 5-8)

#### Week 5-6: Messaging System
- Template management
- Guest communication
- Vendor messaging
- Message history

#### Week 7-8: QR Code System
- Guest check-in codes
- Table assignment QR
- Digital place cards
- Scanner interface

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 9-12)
- Collaborative planning
- Data export
- Performance monitoring
- WebSocket support

## Rollback Procedures

### Level 1: Feature Flag (Immediate)
```typescript
// In production, disable via environment variable
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_[FEATURE]=false
```
- No deployment needed
- Takes effect on next page load
- Zero downtime

### Level 2: Code Rollback (Quick)
```bash
# Revert frontend changes only
git revert [commit-hash]
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
- Keep backend intact
- 5-minute rollback
- Minimal disruption

### Level 3: Full Rollback (Complete)
```bash
# Full system rollback
./scripts/rollback-feature.sh [feature-name]
```
- Reverts database migrations
- Removes feature code
- Cleans up artifacts

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
1. **Adoption Rate**
   - Target: 50% discover within 2 weeks
   - Measure: Feature access logs

2. **Error Rate**
   - Target: <1% API errors
   - Alert: >2% triggers rollback

3. **Performance Impact**
   - Target: <100ms additional load
   - Alert: >200ms triggers investigation

4. **User Satisfaction**
   - Target: 4.5/5 rating
   - Measure: In-app feedback

### Monitoring Dashboard
```typescript
// Real-time metrics
- Feature adoption rates
- Error rates by feature
- Performance metrics
- User feedback scores
```

## Communication Plan

### Internal Team
- Daily standup updates
- Slack alerts for issues
- Weekly progress reports

### User Communication
- In-app announcements for new features
- Email updates for major releases
- Help documentation updates

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks & Mitigations

1. **Database Overload**
   - Risk: New features strain DB
   - Mitigation: Implement caching, connection pooling
   - Monitoring: DB query performance

2. **UI Complexity**
   - Risk: Users confused by new features
   - Mitigation: Progressive disclosure, tooltips
   - Monitoring: User engagement metrics

3. **API Breaking Changes**
   - Risk: Backend updates break frontend
   - Mitigation: API versioning, backward compatibility
   - Monitoring: API error rates

## Emergency Contacts

### Escalation Path
1. **On-Call Developer**: Check #oncall Slack
2. **Team Lead**: [Contact Info]
3. **Infrastructure**: [Contact Info]
4. **Product Owner**: [Contact Info]

### Emergency Procedures
```bash
# Disable all new features immediately
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES=false

# Check system health
npm run health-check

# View error logs
npm run logs:errors

# Generate incident report
npm run incident:report
```

## Appendix: Feature Enable Commands

### Development Testing
```bash
# Enable individual features
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SEATING=true npm run dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CHECKLIST=true npm run dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TIMELINE=true npm run dev

# Enable phase groups
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PHASE_1=true npm run dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PHASE_2=true npm run dev

# Enable all features (dev only)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES=true npm run dev
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Update production environment
vercel env pull
# Edit .env.production
vercel env push

# Deploy with features
vercel --prod
```
