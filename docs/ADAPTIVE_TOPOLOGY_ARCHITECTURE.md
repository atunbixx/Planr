// Initialize topology manager
const manager = new AdaptiveTopologyManager({
  type: 'hybrid',
  maxNodes: 20,
  healingEnabled: true,
  targetEfficiency: 0.8
})

// Register new agent
await manager.addAgent({
  id: 'worker-1',

  load: 0.3,
  performance: {
    responseTime: 150,
    successRate: 0.95,
    throughput: 10.0
  }
})

// Trigger optimization
await manager.forceOptimization()

// Get current metrics
const metrics = manager.getMetrics()
console.log(`Network efficiency: ${metrics.efficiency * 100}%`)
```

### PWA Integration
```tsx
import TopologyManager from '@/components/pwa/TopologyManager'

function App() {
  return (
    <TopologyManager
      config={{
        type: 'hybrid',
        maxNodes: 30,
        healingEnabled: true,
        targetEfficiency: 0.8
      }}
      enableVisualization={true}
    >
      <YourAppContent />
    </TopologyManager>
  )
}
```

### Service Worker Coordination
```typescript
// In service worker context
import { initializeTopologyCoordinator } from '@/lib/topology/sw-topology-coordinator'

// Initialize coordinator
const coordinator = initializeTopologyCoordinator({
  enableBackgroundOptimization: true,
  optimizationInterval: 60000,
  maxBackgroundAgents: 20
})

// Handle agent registration
self.addEventListener('message', async (event) => {
  if (event.data.type === 'register-agent') {
    await coordinator.registerAgent(event.data.agent)
  }
})
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Debug Interface
The topology manager exposes a debug interface on the global window object:
```javascript
// Access topology manager from browser console
const topologyDebug = window.__TOPOLOGY_MANAGER__

// Get current network state
console.log(topologyDebug.state)

// Trigger manual optimization
await topologyDebug.triggerOptimization()

// View network health
console.log(topologyDebug.networkHealth)
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Enable performance tracking
const performanceHistory = manager.getPerformanceHistory()

// Analyze topology evolution
const efficiencyTrend = performanceHistory.map(entry => ({
  timestamp: entry.timestamp,
  efficiency: entry.metrics.efficiency,
  topology: entry.topology
}))
```

### Event Logging
All topology events are logged and can be monitored:
```typescript
// Listen for topology events
window.addEventListener('topology-event', (event) => {
  console.log('Topology event:', event.detail)
})
```
