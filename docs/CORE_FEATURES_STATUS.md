# Core Wedding Planning Features Implementation Status

## 📊 Overall Status

The core wedding planning features (Guests, Budget, Vendors, Photos) have been implemented with varying levels of completeness. The backend uses a mix of Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL (for guests) and direct Supabase queries (for budget, vendors, photos).

## 🎯 Feature-by-Feature Status

### 1. **Guest Management** ✅ (90% Complete)

#### Implemented:
- ✅ Guest list view with statistics
- ✅ Add guest dialog component
- ✅ Guest list component with search/filter
- ✅ API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) - **Just completed full CRUD operations**
- ✅ RSVP tracking with status (pending, confirmed, declined)
- ✅ Plus-one management
- ✅ Dietary restrictions and notes
- ✅ Invitation code generation
- ✅ Performance optimization with caching
- ✅ QR code generator component

#### Missing:
- ❌ Bulk import/export functionality
- ❌ Email/SMS invitation sending
- ❌ Seating assignment integration

### 2. **Budget Management** 🔄 (70% Complete)

#### Implemented:
- ✅ Budget overview page
- ✅ Expense tracking with categories
- ✅ Add expense dialog

#### Issues:
- ⚠️ Using direct Supabase queries instead of Prisma
- ⚠️ Inconsistent with rest of application architecture
- ❌ Missing budget vs actual comparison charts
- ❌ No payment reminders
- ❌ No receipt upload functionality

### 3. **Vendor Management** 🔄 (75% Complete)

#### Implemented:

- ✅ API endpoints (GET, POST)

#### Missing:
- ❌ PUT and DELETE endpoints
- ❌ Contract document upload
- ❌ Payment schedule tracking
- ❌ Vendor communication history
- ⚠️ Using direct Supabase queries

### 4. **Photo Management** 🔄 (80% Complete)

#### Implemented:
- ✅ Photo gallery view
- ✅ Album management
- ✅ Photo upload dialog
- ✅ Photo grid with lazy loading
- ✅ Album creation and organization
- ✅ Photo stats tracking
- ✅ API endpoints for fetching photos
- ✅ Cloudinary integration for storage
- ✅ Performance optimization with caching

#### Missing:
- ❌ Photo upload endpoint implementation
- ❌ Bulk photo operations
- ❌ Photo sharing functionality
- ❌ Guest photo submissions
- ⚠️ Using direct Supabase queries

## 🔧 Technical Debt & Issues

### 1. **Architecture Inconsistency**
- Guest management uses Prisma ORM with API routes
- Budget, Vendors, and Photos use direct Supabase queries in server components
- This creates maintenance challenges and inconsistent patterns

### 2. **Missing Standardization**
- Need to standardize all features to use Prisma ORM
- Implement consistent API route patterns
- Add proper error handling and validation

### 3. **Incomplete CRUD Operations**
- Several features missing PUT/DELETE endpoints
- Need to complete all CRUD operations for each feature

### 4. **Performance Considerations**
- Guest management has caching implemented
- Other features need similar optimization
- Need to implement pagination for large datasets

## 📝 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Complete Vendor API** - Add PUT and DELETE endpoints
2. **Implement Photo Upload** - Complete the upload functionality
3. **Standardize Architecture** - Migrate all features to use Prisma ORM

### Short-term Goals:
1. **Add Missing Features**:
   - Bulk guest import/export
   - Budget visualization charts
   - Vendor document management
   - Photo sharing capabilities

2. **Improve UX**:
   - Add loading skeletons to all features
   - Implement optimistic updates
   - Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add caching to all API endpoints
   - Implement pagination
   - Optimize database queries

### Long-term Goals:
1. **Integration Features**:
   - Connect guests with seating planner
   - Link vendors with budget expenses
   - Associate photos with timeline events

2. **Communication Features**:
   - Guest invitation system
   - Vendor communication tracking
   - Automated reminders

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Budget recommendations based on averages
   - Vendor ratings and reviews
   - AI-powered photo organization

## ✅ Recent Progress

Just completed:
- ✅ Full CRUD operations for Guest API
- ✅ Performance optimization documentation
- ✅ Dashboard loading improvements
- ✅ Database query optimization

## 🎯 Current Priority

The core features are functional but need:
1. **Architectural standardization** (migrate to Prisma)
2. **Complete API implementations** (missing endpoints)
3. **UX improvements** (loading states, error handling)
4. **Feature integration** (connect related features)
