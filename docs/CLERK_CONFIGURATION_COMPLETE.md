# Clerk Configuration Complete ✅

## What Was Configured

I've successfully configured Clerk to redirect users appropriately after authentication:

### 1. Environment Variables Added

The following environment variables have been added to your `.env` and `.env.local` files:

```env
# Clerk Redirect URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/onboarding    # New users go to onboarding
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard     # Existing users go to dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in             # Sign in page
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up             # Sign up page
```

### 2. How It Works Now

#### For New Users:
1. User signs up at `/sign-up`
2. After successful signup, Clerk redirects to `/onboarding`
3. User completes the 4-step onboarding carousel
4. After completion, user is redirected to `/dashboard`

#### For Existing Users:
1. User signs in at `/sign-in`
2. After successful signin, Clerk redirects to `/dashboard`
3. If they haven't completed onboarding, middleware redirects to `/onboarding`

### 3. Testing the Configuration

To test that everything is working:

1. **Test New User Flow**:
   - Open an incognito/private browser window
   - Go to `http://localhost:4010`
   - Click "Sign Up" or go to `/sign-up`
   - Create a new account
   - Verify you're redirected to `/onboarding`
   - Complete the onboarding flow
   - Verify you end up at `/dashboard`

2. **Test Existing User Flow**:
   - Sign out if you're signed in
   - Go to `/sign-in`
   - Sign in with existing credentials
   - Verify you're redirected to `/dashboard`

### 4. Additional Configuration (Optional)

If the environment variables alone don't work, you can also configure these URLs in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Select your application
3. Navigate to **Paths** in the sidebar
4. Set:
   - **Sign-up URL**: `/sign-up`
   - **Sign-in URL**: `/sign-in`
   - **After sign-up URL**: `/onboarding`
   - **After sign-in URL**: `/dashboard`

### 5. Middleware Protection

The middleware (`/src/middleware.ts`) is configured to:
- Protect all dashboard routes
- Check if users have completed onboarding
- Redirect new users (created within 5 minutes) to `/onboarding`
- Allow access to public routes without authentication

### 6. Troubleshooting

If users aren't being redirected properly:

1. **Clear browser cache** and cookies
2. **Restart the development server**:
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   # Start it again
   npm run dev -- --port 4010
   ```
3. **Check browser console** for any errors
4. **Verify environment variables** are loaded:
   - Check that `.env.local` exists
   - Ensure no typos in variable names
5. **Check Clerk Dashboard** settings if env vars don't work

## Summary

✅ Environment variables configured in `.env` and `.env.local`
✅ New users will be redirected to `/onboarding` after signup
✅ Existing users will be redirected to `/dashboard` after signin
✅ Middleware protects routes and enforces onboarding completion
✅ Beautiful 4-step onboarding carousel ready for new users
