# Codebase Migration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for migrating all authentication fixes, database improvements, and New York Magazine theme changes from the current working codebase to a fresh copy of the codebase in a different directory. This ensures the user has a clean, fully functional version with all improvements applied systematically.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Theme System Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the complete New York Magazine theme system migrated to the new codebase, so that I have a consistent, professional design system across all pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating the theme system THEN the system SHALL copy all theme files from src/styles/theme/ directory
2. WHEN applying the theme THEN the system SHALL include colors.ts, typography.ts, components.ts, spacing.ts, and animations.ts
3. WHEN migrating theme files THEN the system SHALL ensure the main theme export file (index.ts) is properly configured
4. WHEN theme is applied THEN the system SHALL verify all theme utilities and helper functions are available

### Requirement 2: Authentication System Migration

**User Story:** As a user, I want all authentication fixes migrated to the new codebase, so that login functionality works correctly without any database or authentication issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating authentication THEN the system SHALL copy all fixed authentication components and pages
2. WHEN applying auth fixes THEN the system SHALL include the corrected signin page with proper form handling
3. WHEN migrating auth system THEN the system SHALL copy the updated dashboard layout with proper authentication checks
4. WHEN auth is migrated THEN the system SHALL ensure proper session management and redirect logic is preserved

### Requirement 3: Database Migration Files Transfer

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all database migration files copied to the new codebase, so that the database schema issues are resolved in the new environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating database files THEN the system SHALL copy all migration files from supabase/migrations/ directory
2. WHEN transferring migrations THEN the system SHALL include 20250108120000_create_missing_tables.sql
3. WHEN copying database files THEN the system SHALL include 20250108121000_fix_table_references.sql
4. WHEN migrations are copied THEN the system SHALL preserve the exact SQL content and file structure

### Requirement 4: Themed Page Components Migration

**User Story:** As a user, I want all themed page components migrated to the new codebase, so that I have a consistent New York Magazine design across all dashboard pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating themed pages THEN the system SHALL copy all updated dashboard pages with NY Magazine theme applied
2. WHEN applying themed components THEN the system SHALL include the updated dashboard home page
3. WHEN migrating pages THEN the system SHALL copy any themed versions of tasks, budget, guests, and other dashboard pages
4. WHEN themed pages are applied THEN the system SHALL ensure all components use the theme system consistently

### Requirement 5: Debug and Utility Scripts Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all debugging and utility scripts migrated to the new codebase, so that I can troubleshoot and test the system in the new environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating utility files THEN the system SHALL copy all debugging scripts created during the authentication fix process
2. WHEN transferring debug tools THEN the system SHALL include test-auth.js, debug-login-flow.js, and other diagnostic scripts
3. WHEN copying utilities THEN the system SHALL preserve the exact functionality and configuration of each script
4. WHEN debug tools are migrated THEN the system SHALL ensure they work with the new directory structure

### Requirement 6: Configuration and Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper configuration guidance for the new codebase, so that I can set up the environment correctly with all necessary dependencies and settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the new codebase THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on environment variable configuration
2. WHEN configuring the new environment THEN the system SHALL ensure Supabase connection settings are properly documented
3. WHEN setting up dependencies THEN the system SHALL verify all required packages are installed and configured
4. WHEN environment is configured THEN the system SHALL provide instructions for running database migrations

### Requirement 7: File Structure Preservation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the exact file structure and organization preserved in the new codebase, so that all imports, references, and dependencies work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating files THEN the system SHALL preserve the exact directory structure and file organization
2. WHEN copying components THEN the system SHALL maintain all import paths and relative references
3. WHEN transferring files THEN the system SHALL ensure no broken imports or missing dependencies
4. WHEN structure is preserved THEN the system SHALL verify all file relationships and dependencies are intact

### Requirement 8: Verification and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want verification that all migrated components work correctly in the new codebase, so that I can be confident the migration was successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a checklist of components to verify
2. WHEN testing the migration THEN the system SHALL include steps to test authentication functionality
3. WHEN verifying the setup THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on testing the theme system
4. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL confirm all major features are working correctly
