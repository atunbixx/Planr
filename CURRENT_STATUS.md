# Wedding Planner App - Current Status Report

## 🎉 Enterprise Transformation Status: COMPLETE

The application has been successfully transformed into an enterprise-grade system with feature-modular architecture, repository pattern, and unified database schema. All cascading failures have been resolved.

## 🏗️ **Enterprise Architecture Implemented**

### **Database Schema Unification** ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**
